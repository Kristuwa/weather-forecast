# About this App

The Trip app allows users to plan their upcoming journeys by providing weather forecasts for selected destinations. Users can view a visualization of the main page and a static list of trips upon starting the application, with the ability to scroll through the list. Selecting a trip displays a forecast for each day of the journey. The app features a search option for finding trips, as well as an "Add trip" button that opens a modal window where users can choose a city from a predefined list, enter the start and end dates of the trip, and add it to the list. Additionally, the app shows today's weather forecast for the selected trip's city and includes a countdown timer to the trip's start date.
